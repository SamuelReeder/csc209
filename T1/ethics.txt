I believe this would be an ethical violation regardless of what the perpetrator does with the file. Two parties 
can be mutually responsible for an ethics violations, in this case the individual who published their files and 
those who access them. To my knowledge, this work is supposed to be individual and therefore any collaboration 
is technically illict. In academic integrity violations, both the party whom shared their work and the party 
whom viewed the work are held responsible and one would assume the same applies here. The best course of action 
would be to not view or interact with the peers files in any way even if you noticed they were shared. In terms 
of the person who shared them, they should have avoided doing that in the first place and perhaps revoke those 
public permissions as soon as possible to prevent furthering their misdeed. We may revisit Lecture 0 to 
understand why this is still a "harm" even in the event that no one is directly harmed. We established that one 
can can harm another even if that harm is never noticed by the other party, and one can harm another even if the 
harm was not caused by either party. In the present example, both parties could be responsible of each type of 
harm. With the individual sharing the file unknowingly harming another by making their file accessible, and the 
viewer harming the other without meaning to cause harm, and that harm never being noticed by the originating 
party.
