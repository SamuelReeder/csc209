# CSC209 Assignments and Tutorials

This is the coursework completed during my enrollment in the CSC209 spring class of 2024. Everything was completed with only standard C libraries. Some noteable assigments include:
- server-client audio streaming and file transfer.
- linux shell emulator.
- streetmap pathfinding program.

Its a pretty cool course. I enjoyed the low-level C programming.
